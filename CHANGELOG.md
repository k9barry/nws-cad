    - recent-calls-table.php (42 lines) - Standalone table component
  - Updated partials/README.md with new structure documentation
  - Reduced table max-height from 770px to 500px for better proportions


### Fixed
- **Units Popover Bug**
  - Fixed API response format handling: Changed from `result.items` to `result.data` to match actual API response structure
  - Fixed primary unit badge: Changed from `u.primary_unit` to `u.is_primary` (correct field name)
  - Units popover now displays correctly with unit details and status


### Changed
- **Dashboard Layout Restructured**
  - Recent Calls table moved below stats cards (right column only)
  - Map height increased to 800px to fill left column
  - Layout now: Map (left 40%) | Stats Cards + Recent Calls (right 60%, stacked)
  - Table max-height reduced to 400px for better proportions
  - Removed standalone recent-calls-table.php partial (merged into map-and-stats.php)


### Changed
- **Dashboard Header Optimization**
  - Merged filter controls into header row (single row layout)
  - Dashboard title on left, filter summary and button on right
  - Removed standalone filter-summary.php partial (merged into dashboard.php)
  - Map now starts immediately below header (more vertical space)
  - Reduced header margin from mb-4 to mb-3 for tighter layout


### Fixed
- **Recent Calls Table Positioning**
  - Fixed HTML structure: Table now correctly positioned in right column below stats cards
  - Corrected closing div tags that were pushing table outside the column layout


### Added
- **Map Boundary Restrictions**
  - Map now restricted to Madison County, Indiana boundaries
  - maxBounds set to prevent panning outside county (~40mi buffer)
  - maxBoundsViscosity: 1.0 creates "hard" boundaries (can't drag outside)
  - minZoom: 9 prevents zooming out too far
  - Coordinates: SW (39.90°N, 85.90°W) to NE (40.35°N, 85.45°W)

### Confirmed
- **Units Popover "Full Details" Button**
  - Already correctly opens call details modal via viewCallDetails() function
  - No changes needed - functionality already working as intended


### Fixed
- **Units Popover "Full Details" Button**
  - Fixed button not opening call details modal
  - Added event.stopPropagation() to prevent click event from bubbling
  - Added setTimeout(100ms) to ensure popover closes before modal opens
  - Button now correctly closes popover and opens call details modal

  - loadRecentCalls() function now accepts page parameter
  - Tracks currentCallsPage, totalCallsPages, currentCallsTotal state


### Fixed
- **Jurisdiction Filter Dropdown - Missing Jurisdictions**
  - **Root Cause**: Stats API had `LIMIT 10` on jurisdiction query, only showing top 10 most frequent jurisdictions in dropdown
  - **Impact**: Less frequent jurisdictions (like 48020) were not available as filter options
  - **Solution**: Removed LIMIT 10 from calls_by_jurisdiction query in StatsController
  - **Result**: All jurisdictions now appear in filter dropdown (went from 10 to 17 in current dataset)
  - Example: Call 1093 with jurisdiction 48020 now filterable


### Changed
- **Default Filter Period**
  - Changed default quick select filter from "Last 7 Days" to "Today"
  - Dashboard now shows today's calls by default on first load

  - Filter summary correctly shows "Today" instead of "All Time" on first load


### Changed
- **Map Zoom Limits**
  - Increased maximum zoom level from 19 to 21 (2 additional zoom levels)
  - Allows users to zoom in closer for more detailed street-level views
  - Both map container and tile layer maxZoom increased to 21
  - Minimum zoom (9) remains unchanged to prevent zooming out past county view


### Changed
- **Map Minimum Zoom Level**
  - Increased minimum zoom from level 9 to level 12 (3 levels more zoomed in)
  - Prevents users from zooming out to county-wide view
  - Keeps map focused on more detailed city/neighborhood level
  - Users cannot zoom out past level 12 (was level 9)
  - Both map container and tile layer minZoom increased to 12

  - Updated default starting zoom from 10 to 12 (matches new minimum)
  - Map now initializes at city/neighborhood level instead of county-wide


### Changed
- **Map Minimum Zoom Adjusted**
  - Changed minimum zoom from level 12 to level 10
  - Allows slightly more zoom out capability
  - Still prevents extreme zoom out (original was level 9)
  - Default starting zoom remains at level 10 (matches minimum)
  - Balance between detail and overview


### Changed

  - Changed minimum zoom from level 10 to level 11
  - Changed default starting zoom from level 10 to level 11
  - Slightly more focused view with better detail
